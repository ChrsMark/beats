=== Running Metricbeat on Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK)

We already know how to run Metricbeat on Kubernetes. However, since Elasticsearch and Kibana can also run on Kubernetes
by leveraging the ECK (Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes), a user would like to deploy Metrcibeat along with ECK managed clucters.
ECK is based on the Kubernetes Operator pattern and it is built for managing Elasticsearch and Kibana on Kubernetes.

In this section we cover the process of:

1. Deploying ECK
2. Deploying a monitoring ES+Kibana cluster
3. Deploying Metricbeat reporting k8s metrics to the monitoring cluster

==== Preparing Minikube
If you are going to use Minikube, configure it with the resources needed and start it up:
["source", "sh", subs="attributes"]
------------------------------------------------
minikube delete
minikube config set memory 16384
minikube config set cpus 4
minikube start
------------------------------------------------

==== Deploying ECK

First of all we need to deploy the operator:
["source", "sh", subs="attributes"]
------------------------------------------------
kubectl apply -f https://download.elastic.co/downloads/eck/1.0.1/all-in-one.yaml
------------------------------------------------

Once deployed, you can use the following command to monitor logs from the operator and make sure everything goes well.
It just takes a few moments for ECK to be up and running.

["source", "sh", subs="attributes"]
------------------------------------------------
kubectl -n elastic-system logs -f statefulset.apps/elastic-operator
------------------------------------------------

==== Deploying a monitoring ES+Kibana cluster
Now that ECK is running, we are ready to deploy an Elasticsearch+Kibana cluster.

Deploy the stack with the following commands:

["source", "sh", subs="attributes"]
------------------------------------------------
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/master/config/recipes/beats/0_ns.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/master/config/recipes/beats/1_monitor.yaml
kubectl get elasticsearch,kibana
------------------------------------------------

Once both components become green, your Elasticsearch cluster is up and running and ready for data to come in.


[float]
==== Accessing Kibana

By default, Kibana is exposed as a service with a cluster IP accessible from within the cluster but is not exposed to the internet.
However, you can use the following port forwarding command to make Kibana accessible from your laptop:
["source", "sh", subs="attributes"]
------------------------------------------------
kubectl port-forward -n beats service/monitor-kb-http 5601
------------------------------------------------

Before we can log into Kibana, we need to get the default elastic user’s credentials.
You can run kubectl get secrets and then inspect the secret to find the JSON path of the secret.
Here is the correct secret and path for our case:

["source", "sh", subs="attributes"]
------------------------------------------------
echo `kubectl get secret monitor-es-elastic-user -o=jsonpath='{.data.elastic}' -n beats | base64 --decode`
------------------------------------------------

The password for the elastic user is displayed. Copy and save it into a notepad.

Now, open a browser and connect to https://localhost:5601. Since we are using a self-signed certificate, you will need
to accept the browser’s security warning. Log into Kibana using the elastic user and the password you just retrieved.
You’ll be taken to the homepage of Kibana. Our cluster is totally ready!

==== Deploy kube-state-metrics

Metricbeat gets some metrics from https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics#usage[kube-state-metrics].
If `kube-state-metrics` is not already running, deploy it now (see the
https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics#kubernetes-deployment[Kubernetes
deployment] docs).

["source", "sh", subs="attributes"]
------------------------------------------------
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics.git kube-state-metrics
kubectl create -f kube-state-metrics/kubernetes
------------------------------------------------


[float]
==== Deploy Metricbeat
Metricbeat in order to connect to Elasticsearch will use `elasticsearch-monitoring-es-elastic-user` and `elasticsearch-monitoring-es-http-certs-public`
secrets that are already created by the Operator.


The following command will deploy Metricbeat:

["source", "sh", subs="attributes"]
------------------------------------------------
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/master/config/recipes/beats/3_metricbeat-kubernetes.yaml
------------------------------------------------



[float]
====  Explore your Metrics
Now that everything is set up, navigate to Infrastructure panel of Kibana and see the overview of your Kubernetes cluster.
In addition, Kubernetes and System dashboards have been automatically loaded and can already give great insights of your cluster.



[float]
==== Add more insigths
Now that Metricbeat is collecting metrics, one can go to the next step and add Filebeat (see <<running-filebeat-on-eck>>)
to enrich the insights.
